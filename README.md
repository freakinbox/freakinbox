- 👋 Hi, I’m @freakinbox,
	I really started this journey when I was a child and would steal my fathers tools to dismantle my toys without anyone knowing. I’m still surprised none of those old TV’s or monitors ever killed me. I looked at coding in secondary school in the early 2000’s but the program was lacking and the teacher was lousy. Nevertheless it set the foundations of what would be object oriented programming with me that I now seem to use when I do it for a hobby. Ultimately if I wanted my computers and such to work in a time where they broke a lot it was on me to figure it out or no computer to enjoy.
	There have been a few stints where I have looked at picking it up for LUA and ended up just learning the internal wiremod2 code used in Gmod (Garry’s Mod) to build various contraptions. But nothing stuck because I didn’t have much of a personal use for it. I’ve since picked up Linux and am focused on using both Windows and Linux as development environments at the same time.

- 👀 I’m interested in the general building and maintenance of PC hardware and software, similar to cars. I enjoy learning skills that are useful to me in the bigger picture.
- 👀 I’m also interested in learning a few different coding languages. Specifically Python, Java, C++, and LUA.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, web scraping, and data analysis. Data analysis is focused on the various stock markets currently but I want to expand it further as I write different parts of my personal program.
- 💞️ I would be willing to collaborate on small python projects
